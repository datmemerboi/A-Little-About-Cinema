## **Groundhog Day** (1993), **Happy Death Day** (2017) & **Game Over** (2019)

When Groundhog Day released in 1993, it was appreciated by both fans and film critics as well. A film about a self-absorbed, egoistic news reporter stuck in the same day until he finds better manners and true love caught the attention of many. The film as a whole convinced people because of it’s humour and the character arc of Phil. Since then, the concept of a Time Loop has been implemented various number of times (Dormamu didn’t get a great bargain…)

But what if he doesn’t have enough time?

What if he couldn’t go on and on with this time loop?

**Happy Death Day (2017)**

A college student wakes up in a dorm room, on her birthday, just to get murdered few hours later. This is the plotline of **Happy Death Day** (2017). Unlike Phil, Tree cannot stay in this loop forever. The main reason being, each death has a toll on her body.

**Game Over (2019)**

On a New Year’s Eve, a game developer, Swapna, has win the game of her life. Sounds like a waffer thin plot, but this isn’t all that is packaged into **Game Over** (2019). This extremely intense thriller has such great detailing and layers, it practically grows on it’s own.


The common thread in these two films: _the protagonist doesn’t have enough time_. It’s not about them stuck in a time loop, but that they’re stuck (with death not be that far away) until they find the killer on their own.

**SPOILER:** Probably the most intelligent move in Game Over is not giving a back story or a reveal of who the killer is. This mystery elevates the suspense to a much higher level.

So, my point here is, not letting the character just be stuck in a loop, but actually playing with the possibilities might make the story much, much better.
