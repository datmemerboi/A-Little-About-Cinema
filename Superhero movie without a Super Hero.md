Superhero movie.. without a "Super Hero"?

## *Mugagmoodi (2012)*, *Deadpool (2016)* & *Mard Ko Dard Nahi Hota (2019)*
**Origin Story:**
A weak, troubled protagonist has to fight his fears and enemies when he is gifted with a superpower.

**The Sequel:**
The hero has to stay hidden as everyone scrutinizes the useage of his powers. When there is a dire need for help, he comes out, after a long portion of self-growth and training montages, to save the world once again.

Ofcourse a bunch combine to form a team and fight a world-wide threat.

Is this the only kind of superhero movies that we will keep accepting? Is there no other way to make a superhero movie?

This is when we get
>**Deadpool (2016)**

This movie took the entire factor of "guy getting super powers" and uped it a notch by making him screw it himself.
We didn't have one scene of "Why did I get these powers?", "How do I use this wisely?". It was all "Eh! Fuck you for making me into this!". It is just the perfect superhero movie. The movie had around 8 years of work go into it and it shows.

But even that had a "Save the girl" plot, which too has become a common thread. So what do we do about that?

Mard Ko Dard Nahi Hota isn't like any other superhero movie we've seen before because, IT IS NOT A SUPERHERO MOVIE. Yet, the best part of MKDNH is that it has the perfect plot for an origin story. The protagonist has a very simple & character driven quest / goal.

Surya doesn't have a fixed goal though. He wants to become **Karate Man**. He yearns, he trains & practices to be just like Karate Man. But once he gets to meet the one and only, his goal shifts. It isn't about just being or knowing Karate Man, but he gets a chance to help Karate Man in succeeding in his fight against Jimmy.
