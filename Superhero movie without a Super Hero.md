Superhero movie.. without a "Super Hero"?

## *Mugagmoodi (2012)*, *Deadpool (2016)* & *Mard Ko Dard Nahi Hota (2019)*
**Origin Story:**
A weak, troubled protagonist has to fight his fears and enemies when he is gifted with a superpower.

**The Sequel:**
The hero has to stay hidden as everyone scrutinizes the useage of his powers. When there is a dire need for help, he comes out, after a long portion of self-growth and training montages, to save the world once again.

Ofcourse a bunch combine to form a team and fight a world-wide threat.

Is this the only kind of superhero movies that we will keep accepting? Is there no other way to make a superhero movie?

This is when we get

This movie took the entire factor of "guy getting super powers" and uped it a notch by making him screw it himself.
We didn't have one scene of "Why did I get these powers?", "How do I use this wisely?". It was all "Eh! Fuck you for making me into this!". It is just the perfect superhero movie. The movie had around 8 years of work go into it and it shows.

But even that had a "Save the girl" motif, which too has become a common thread. So what do we do about that?
